"YIPL has assigned us the task of creating a website based on the Figma design. This is a frontend design task intended for all interested interns, aimed at assessing their knowledge, skills, and command of programming languages and tools.

I am pleased to submit my design to YIPL and hope that they will appreciate and approve of my workflow."
